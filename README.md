## Contributing

Our packages are written in Typescript, we use [lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) to manage dependencies. You'll need to have [yarn installed](https://yarnpkg.com/docs/install) to develop these packages. Then you can fetch dependencies with:

```bash
yarn install
```

We use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) to share git pre-commit hooks. You'll need to [install it](https://pre-commit.com/#install) and set it up for our repo with:

```bash
pre-commit install
```
